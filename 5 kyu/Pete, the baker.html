    // Unfortunately he is not good in maths. Can you help him to find out,
    // how many cakes he could bake considering his recipes?

    // (also an object) and returns the maximum number of cakes Pete can bake (integer).
    // For simplicity there are no units for the amounts (e.g. 1 lb of flour or 200 g of sugar are simply 1 or 200).
    // Ingredients that are not present in the objects, can be considered as 0.
