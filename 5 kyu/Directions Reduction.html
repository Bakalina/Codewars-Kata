// Write a function dirReduc which will take an array of strings and returns
//  an array of strings with the needless directions removed (W<->E or S<->N side by side).

// The Haskell version takes a list of directions with data Direction = North | East | West | South.
// The Clojure version returns nil when the path is reduced to nothing.
// The Rust version takes a slice of enum Direction {North, East, West, South}.
// See more examples in "Sample Tests:"


const dirReduc = arr => {
    let road = /NORTHSOUTH|SOUTHNORTH|EASTWEST|WESTEAST/g
    let arrString = arr.join('')
    while (road.test(arrString)) {
        arrString = arrString.replace(road , '')
    }
  return arrString.match(/(NORTH|SOUTH|EAST|WEST)/g)||[];
}

console.log(dirReduc(["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"]));
